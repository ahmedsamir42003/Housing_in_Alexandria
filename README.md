# Housing Price Analysis in Alexandria
This project focuses on analyzing housing prices in Egypt using a dataset named "Egypt_Houses_Price.csv." The dataset contains essential features such as the property type, price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, area, furnished status, level, compound, payment options, delivery date, delivery term, and city.

The dataset underwent extensive data preprocessing to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and standardize the data for analysis. Pandas, NumPy, and regular expressions (re) were utilized for data cleaning and manipulation. Additionally, the FuzzyWuzzy library was employed to handle fuzzy matching and improve data accuracy.

Following the data preprocessing stage, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted using the powerful visualization libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn. Through various charts and graphs, insights were gained into the distribution of house prices, and other significant patterns in the data. EDA provided a comprehensive understanding of the housing market in Egypt, with a specific focus on the city of Alexandria.

Furthermore, a regression model was developed using the Scikit-learn (sklearn) library to predict house prices based on the available features. Multiple regression algorithms were employed, including linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. Model performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.

This project not only showcased expertise in data preprocessing, data visualization, and regression modeling but also provided valuable insights into the housing market in Egypt. By sharing the code and findings, it is aimed to contribute to the data science community and foster discussions on housing prices and market trends in Egypt.
